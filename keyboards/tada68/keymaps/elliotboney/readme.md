# elliotboney's TADA68 layout

This layout does a couple things:
* make the tada layout more like my traditional mac keyboards
* use < and > be volume up and down because it's easier for me to remember the shortcuts!
* Capslock is now gui+control+option+shift since I use it for program shortcuts, fn+caps to do normal capslock
* add breathing toggle from stephengrier's layout
* adds a backtick to fn+escape
* makes right ALT a delete
* against recommendation, added passwords to macro (fn + p, fn + [, fn  + ]) and email to macro (fn + e)
    * either change `secrets.h.sample` to `secrets.h` or update the `secret` constant in `keymap.c`

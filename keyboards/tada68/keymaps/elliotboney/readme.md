# elliotboney's TADA68 layout

This layout does a couple things:
* make the tada layout more like my traditional mac keyboards
* use < and > be volume up and down because it's easier for me to remember the shortcuts!
* add breathing toggle from stephengrier's layout
* adds a backtick to fn+escape
* makes right ALT a delete
* against recommendation, added password to macro
